# Cookie Recipe Exercise

### Exercise

Your Grandma wants you to publish her famous cookie recipe to the world wide web, she's typed it out for you in this .html document (she's so nice).

She absolutely wants the directions to appear in order in a numbered list. The cookies won't taste good if you don't get the order right. (hint you need an ordered list).

Your Grandpa happens to be a great Graphic Designer and gave you the following specs to style:

### HTML Instructions

- Setup the index.html file with all the required tags first.
- Choose the appropriate html tags based on the content provided.
- Add the "cookies.jpg" image after the first heading.

### CSS Instructions

- The size of the most important heading is 40px.
- The background color for the page is #FFE
- The color for the text reading "Related Recipes" is #887
- The link color is #900
- Bonus: The border at the top of the page is white and the border all around the image is black.
